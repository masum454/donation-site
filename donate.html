                <p>
                    Family meals provide an opportunity for family members to come together, strengthen ties and build
                    better relationships. In our overscheduled lives being together with family at dinner is really
                    important, as old tradition used to be.

                <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
                <p>When a storm of harassment disturbs our thinking and brings us down to our knees, the umbrella of our
                    imagination can shield us against destructive aggression. It is offering shelter and is teaching us
                    how to conquer ourselves, train our resilience, and grit our teeth. We better learn to adopt the
                    virtue of endurance, as life consists of both 'passion' and 'patience.'</p>

                    get them to remember your lessons. As a teacher of young children, your primary goal should be to
                    teach them how to learn and to inspire them to love learning.</p>

                <h1>This is Padma-Bridge</h1>
                <p>The Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a two-level road-rail bridge across the Padma River, the main
                    distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh.It connects Shariatpur and Madaripur, linking the
                    southwest of the country to the northern and eastern regions. The bridge was inaugurated on 25 June
                    2022.
                    Considered to be the most challenging construction project in the history of Bangladesh, the steel
                    truss bridge carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single track railway on the lower
                    level.The bridge consists of 41 sections, each 150.12 m (492.5 ft) long and 22.5 m (74 ft) wide,
                    with a total length of 6.15 km (3.82 mi).It is the longest bridge in Bangladesh, the longest
                    bridge over the river Ganges by both span and total length, and features the highest pile depth of
                    any bridge in the world at 120 m (390 ft).</p>
